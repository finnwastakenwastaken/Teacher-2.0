 * One site-wide setting.

 *
 * The columns, for static analysis.
 *
 * Eloquent resolves these at runtime, so nothing here changes behaviour —
 * but without them every `$model->column` is an undefined property to
 * PHPStan, and a genuine typo becomes indistinguishable from a hundred
 * false ones. Keep in step with the migrations: a column added without a
 * line here is invisible to the analyser, and a line here without a column
 * is a lie it will believe.
