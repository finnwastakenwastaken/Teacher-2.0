    |   worse than none, and it leaks whether an address exists. Recovery is
    |   `php artisan admin:reset-password`, run on the server, and is what the
    |   update & security guide documents.

    | Two-factor and passkeys stay enabled: they are already built, cost
    | nothing, and are worth having on the single account that controls the
    | whole site.
